# The Long Johns of Boards

## Overview

Welcome to **The Long Johns of Boards**! This project is a personal tribute to my journey with longboarding, from my early days of picking up the sport in college to the rewarding experience of building my very own longboard. What started as a fun way to get around campus turned into a passion that I shared with my family, who eventually took up longboarding too. This website is dedicated to all the unique boards, stories, and memories created along the way.

## My Longboarding Journey

I discovered longboarding in college as a means of transportation, but it quickly became more than just a way to get around. I fell in love with the freedom, balance, and control that comes with longboarding. Each ride felt like an adventure, and soon enough, I was hitting the streets whenever I could, challenging myself to learn new techniques and tricks.

## Building My Own Longboard

Longboarding sparked a curiosity in me about the mechanics and design of boards, so I set out to create one from scratch. I researched different types of wood, settled on oak for its durability, and learned the ins and outs of board-building. From shaping the deck to adding custom designs, building my longboard was a hands-on experience that gave me a deeper connection to the sport. My custom board became a source of pride, and I’m thrilled to share it with others who may also have a passion for riding.

## A Family Affair

One of the best parts of my longboarding journey has been sharing it with my family. On a visit home, I introduced them to longboarding, and before I knew it, they were hooked too. Watching them pick up the sport and bond over it brought us closer together and created memories that we’ll cherish for years. Longboarding has since become a family tradition.
